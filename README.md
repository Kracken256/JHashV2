# JHashV2 hash function
A new version of JHash is simplified.

I love writing new hash functions. There is something about it that satisfies me. So I invented a few permutation boxes to achieve the desired cryptographic propertiesâ€”all while beating the performance of SHA2-256. This hash function (as far as I can tell) has good diffusion and (should) be collision-resistant. Use at your own risk though I am not an expert cryptographer.
